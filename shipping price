You are developing a program to calculate the shipping cost for a customer's
order. The shipping cost is based on the weight of the order and the distance to the customer's
location. Write a C program to calculate the shipping cost for a customer's order, given the
weight of the order and the distance to the customer's location. 


//Program to calculate the shipping cost of a parcel//
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    float weight,distance,r1,r2,price;
    //Calculation of price according to weight//
    printf("Enter the weight of the parcel (in kg)");
    scanf("%f",&weight);
    printf("\nEnter the per kg rate of shipping");
    scanf("%f",&r1);
    
    float price1 = weight * r1;
    //Calculationof price according to distance//
    printf("\nEnter the distance to be covered (in km)");
    scanf("%f",&distance);
    printf("\nEnter the per km rate of shipping");
    scanf("%f",&r2);
    
    float price2 = distance * r2;
    
    price = price1 + price2;
    printf("\nThe final price of shipping = %.2f",price);
    return 0;
}
