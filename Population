//Write a program to calculate the population of a city//

#include <stdio.h>
int main ()

{
    int p = 30000,p1,y1,p2,total;
    float rate1=20,rate2=30;
    
    p1 = p * 20 / 100;
    y1 = p + p1;
    p2 = y1 * 30 / 100;
    total = y1 + p2;
    printf("\nThe total population after 2 years is : %d",total);
    
    return 0;
}
