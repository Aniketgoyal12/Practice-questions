Suppose distance between GLA University and Delhi is m km (to be entered by user), by BUS you can reach Delhi in 4 hours. Develop a ‘C’ program to calculate speed of bus


// Program to calculate the speed of bus//

#include <stdio.h>
int main()

{
    int d,t=4,v;
    printf("Enter the distance between GLAU and Delhi");
    scanf("%d",&d);
    v = d/t;
    printf("The speed of the bus is : %d",v);
    return 0;
}
