Tom works at an aquarium shop on Saturdays. One Saturday, when Tom gets to work, he is asked to clean a 175-gallon reef tank. His first job is to drain the tank. He puts a hose into the tank and starts a siphon. Tom wonders if the tank will finish draining before he leaves work. He measures the amount of water that is draining out and finds that 12.5 gallons drain out in 30 minutes. So, he figures that the rate is 25 gallons per hour. Develop a ‘C’ program to help Tom to calculate time required to completely clean tank.


//Program to calculate the time to empty a tank//

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    float rate=25,total=175,time;
    time = total /  rate ;
    printf("The time taken to empty the tank = %.2f",time);
    return 0;
}
