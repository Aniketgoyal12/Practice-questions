One day when I was going for a lunch, suddenly rain started, I was very hungry so started running with speed of 4km/h and it took 3 min to reach mess. Help me to develop a ‘C’ program to calculate distance travelled by me.



// Program to find distance covered//

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    float speed=4,time=3,time1,distance;
    //Conversion of time in hours//
    time1 = time / 60;
    //Calculations of distance//
    distance = speed * time1;
    printf("\nThe distance covered is %.2f km",distance);
    return 0;
}
